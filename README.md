# paper-reading

This is a github during doing paper reading of "Towards deep learning models resistant to adversarial attacks, ICLR 2018"

There is a original code & modified & added(FGSM) code in each dataset of MNIST and CIFAR-10.
The 'dataset'.ipynb file is the one used to get the results with each datasets.

The test.ipynb file is to visualize (mostly MNIST) datasets to figure out exactly what informations dataset has, 
and to get a plot with naturally trained and attacked models.
